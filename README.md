# Why is Europe	

<p>This is a super simple script that shows you what people search up about Europe, and is customizable. The program uses a Google search suggestions API to fetch the results. The default query is "Why is [country] so ____". This was mostly created for fun and doesn't have much of a purpose except for this.<p>	

<br>	

<p>The following python modules are required. You can download these with the pip package manager:</p>	
<ul>	
  <li>requests</li>	
</ul>	

<br>	
<p>This is the result of the script with the default query, as of January 13, 2020</p>

<p>Possible todo list:</p>	
<ul>	
  <li>Make it that the results are mapped to each country on a provided image</li>	
  <li>Add the option to do this for different areas of the world, or do it for the whole world at once</li>	
  <li>Allow for user input to let people enter from the terminal the query they want to execute</li>	
</ul>
